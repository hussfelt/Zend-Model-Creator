WHAT?
  This file is manly used to avoid the time spent on creating models for
  ZendFramework projects. It is soly based on Jersey Consultings model type
  as it fit my needs.

  HOW?
  Simply put this file in any given webfolder, configure your parameters
  and access the page from the web.

  RESULT:
  For each table you have in your specified database, a row of <textarea>
  inputs will be created with the code you need to paste into the files!
  Or you can tell Zend Model Creator to create all the files and folders for you
  thus saving you the process of doing that as well. Just move the files into
  your "models" folder.

  FUTURE!
  We may add:
  	* Add "Clean My Appartment" feature
  	* Add comments for PHPDoc on all generated functions
